# Headshot-Feedback (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3657747578)
Headshot Feedback is a lightweight DayZ mod that provides audio feedback for headshots, improving hit confirmation without affecting gameplay balance.

When a player lands a headshot on another player, a short sound is played only for the shooter.
No global sounds, no spam, no immersion breaking effects.

✨ Features:
🔫 Headshot-only feedback
- Triggered on Head and Brain damage zones

🎧 Sound plays only for the shooter
- Other players do not hear anything

🔊 Multiple selectable sounds
- Up to 6 different headshot sounds

🛠️ Server-side configuration
- Easy-to-edit config.json

⚙️ Lightweight & performance friendly
- No loops, no continuous checks, no spam

🔄 Repack allowed
Free to include in modpacks
After the first server start, the mod creates the following file: "/HeadshotFeedback/config.json"
" SelectedSound " -> Selects which headshot sound is used (1 – 6)
" SoundSets " -> List of available sound sets (do not rename unless you know what you're doing) 

🔊 Custom Sounds
You can replace the included .ogg files with your own sounds.
There are 4 pre-made sounds. This means that 2 more can be added or overwritten.
